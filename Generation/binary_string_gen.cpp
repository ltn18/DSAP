 * @abstract:
 * Binary string of length n is a binary representation of
 * p(x) in [0, 2^n-1]. The number of binary strings = 2^n.
 *
 * @description:
 * This program will list all binary string representations
 * of numbers in range [0, 2^n-1].
 *
 * @idea:
 * - Find the first '0' from end, replace that with '1'
 * - Replace all characters after that found '0' to be '0'
 * - If not found '0' -> no more generation
